# Lists of random names in Dutch

This is a collection of thematic word lists that you could use to name a dozen or a few hundred files, servers or variables if it doesn't matter what they're called. I read somewhere that you're a bad programmer if you give variables random names, but since I'm a bad programmer who didn't do Computer Science, I don't really know which legit use cases there are. And I don't have to know - that's the beauty of open source.

Anyway, this collection didn't start in an office. Do you remember playing **Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri**? One of the things that made it an epic game was the characters of the faction leaders, *divided not by nationality, but by ideology*. The city names, on the other hand, were not as distinctive. It felt like they were all created by a 19th-century poet. So I created my own city names, using semantic domains that were suitable for each faction.

The **themes** folder contains the thematic lists in plain text, while the **basenames** folder contains the text files that you'd put in the Alpha Centauri folder.

*Description of themes to be added later*
